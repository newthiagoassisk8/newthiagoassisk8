## 👨‍💻 Full Stack Developer | Front-end Specialist

I am a **Full Stack JavaScript developer** with a **specialization in Front-end**, focused on building modern, high-performance, and well-structured user interfaces, while maintaining a complete view of the system as a whole.

I have a solid foundation in **JavaScript** and work primarily with **React** on the front end and **Node.js** on the back end. I have also worked with **Vue.js** in projects and feel comfortable switching between frameworks when the context requires it.

I like to understand the *why* behind technical decisions, going beyond simply “making things work.” I aim to write clean, predictable, and sustainable code, always thinking about maintainability, readability, and long-term evolution.

### 🎥 Technical content on YouTube

I also create **technical content on YouTube**, where I present real projects, explain technical decisions, and practice technical communication — something I consider essential for a good developer.

For my **friends from other countries** (👋), I currently have **one video in English**, available here:
